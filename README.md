# hello-world
first ever project on GitHub- hopefully the start of many more (<-- Aug, 2021)

This was my first repo, and I am now re-writing it (today is Oct 20, 2024) because that previous one was
(A) old, obviously, so I wanted to update it (I have grown a lot of different hard and soft skills
over the last 3 yrs) to better reflect on myself and my goals... hmmm
and
(B) **embarrassing** to read!

So: yes, here I am- I'm Ellie. I have so many different interests (of course... I mean-
**no one exists in a vacuum**!) that it's hard to narrow them all down and fit something in here that
accurately depicts who I am, what I'm all about, what I bring to the table-- I don't know;
I'm me! 

My favorite coding language is Python, and I *attempted* to learn C/C++ at one point, in hopes of 
eventually becoming a video game designer. I had high aspirations to eventually develop a game with my
sister at various points throughout my youth and young(er) adulthood.

I love to bake (@baked.spaghellie on ig, hehe), I love arts and crafts (I've painted and crocheted so many
different things), I love to make people feel loved, I love laughing, I love movies & TV, I love reading,
and most of all I love being a **mom!** (It's the craziest, wildest, trippiest, most intense rollercoaster
that I never want to get off :) )
