# hello-world
first ever project on GitHub- hopefully the start of many more

To anyone who's reading this: Hi! My name is Ellie, I love dogs & I have a sugar addiction that I'm not proud of.
My sister is an artist (she majored in Game Art at RMCAD some time ago) and I hope to- one day- make video games with her!
I miss being in Japan- no matter how short my spans of time have been there- and speaking, listening, and reading the language.
I have so much more that I want to write!
